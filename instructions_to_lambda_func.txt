Instruction  for uploading a lambda zip file:


#if you want to use mysql >> import module pip install mysql-connector


- mkdir "my_new_lambda"
- virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv #create a virtual environment
- source venv/bin/activate #get in your virtual environment
- touch main.py #create your files to run
## write your lambda function and your dependencies (import modules)
- pip install requests (install your modules on the env )
- pip freeze > req.txt (write the module dependencies to a file) 
- pip install -r req.txt -t . (install all the dependencies on the env)
- deactivate (get out of the virtual env)
- rm -rf venv (remove virtual environment)
- copy to your folder the compress.sh bash script and run it
